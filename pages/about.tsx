          Hi! I'm Cassy, a passionate and dedicated software developer with a
          keen focus on web development.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In a former life, I donned the scrubs as a Registered Nurse before
          making the exciting leap into the world of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey has led me to work alongside a diverse array of
          individuals, spanning from startups to mid-size companies. Always
          hungry for knowledge, I embrace every opportunity to learn and grow.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Beyond coding and debugging, you'll find me engrossed in solving
          puzzlesâ€”murder mysteries happen to be my absolute favorite. When I'm
          not in front of a screen, I love spending quality time with my
          four-legged companion, indulging in long walks and playful moments.
        </p>
