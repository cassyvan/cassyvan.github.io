            Hi! I&apos;m Cassy, a passionate and dedicated software developer
            with a keen focus on

          <p>
            In a former life, I donned the scrubs as a Registered Nurse{" "}
            <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faStethoscope} /> &nbsp; before making the
            exciting leap into the world of technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey has led me to work alongside a diverse array of
            individuals, and my journey in development has spanned from startups
            to mid-size companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always hungry for knowledge, I embrace every opportunity to learn
            and grow. <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLightbulb} />

            Beyond coding and debugging, you&apos;ll find me engrossed in
            solving puzzles &nbsp;
            <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPuzzlePiece} />
            &nbsp; â€”murder mysteries happen to be my absolute favorite.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not in front of a screen, I love spending quality time
            with my four-legged companion, indulging in long walks and playful
            moments. <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPaw} />
