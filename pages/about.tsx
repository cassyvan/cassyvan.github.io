            Hi! I'm Cassy, a passionate and dedicated software developer with a
            keen focus on web development.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            In a former life, I donned the scrubs as a Registered Nurse before
            making the exciting leap into the world of technology.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            My journey has led me to work alongside a diverse array of
            individuals, spanning from startups to mid-size companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always hungry for knowledge, I embrace every opportunity to learn
            and grow.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Beyond coding and debugging, you'll find me engrossed in solving
            puzzlesâ€”murder mysteries happen to be my absolute favorite. When I'm
            not in front of a screen, I love spending quality time with my
            four-legged companion, indulging in long walks and playful moments.
          </p>
